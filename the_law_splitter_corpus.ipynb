That as soon as the said bonds are issued and signed as \\r\\nhereinbefore provided, the said commissioners shall place the same \\r\\nin the hands of the town treasurer who shall thereupon sell and dis- \\r\\npose of the same, or use the same or any part thereof in payment \\r\\nof terminals of rights-of-way under the supervision of the said \\r\\ncommissioners.

This board shall proceed at their own discretion to secure a \\r\\nplant for the university, and endowments both temporary and per- \\r\\nmanent. They shall locate, organize and develop the institution as \\r\\n\\r\\nsoon asin their judgment it can be done with safety and to such \\r\\nextent as the means in hand will justify without incurring debt. \\r\\n\\r\\n(6). Any other sister synods or any new synods formed of parts of \\r\\nthese shall be entitled to elect regents as herein provided on their \\r\\nadoption of this plan of union. \\r\\n\\r\\n(7).

Immediately after the \\r\\njury shall have taken the oath as above prescribed, they shall pro- \\r\\nceed, accompanied by the officer, to view the land of each person \\r\\nmentioned in the writ, and the land of any other person in the \\r\\nimmediate vicinity of [the] proposed improvement which they may \\r\\nconsider to be directly affected thereby. And they shall assess \\r\\nthe damages, if any, specifying the amount to which each and every \\r\\none of the premises which they shall have viewed shall be entitled, \\r\\nand the jury shall at the same time take into consideration any \\r\\nspecial benefit, advantage or enhanced value which in their judg- \\r\\nment may have received by reason of said proposed improvement, \\r\\nand shall state the amount of such special benefit, advantage or \\r\\nenhanced value of each and every one of the owners of said prem- \\r\\nises.

If the jury shall find that the \\r\\nproposed improvement will enhance the value of real estate adja- \\r\\ncent thereto the amount of such valuation of benefit shall vest in \\r\\nthe city and become [a] lien on the premises mentioned in report of the \\r\\njury, and shall be due to the city on the completion of the proposed \\r\\nwork and payable in three equal annual installments, and if not paid \\r\\nat maturity the lot so assessed, or so much thereof as may be neces- \\r\\nsary to pay said installments and costs, shall be sold by the tax-collector \\r\\nto pay the same under the same rules, regulations and restrictions, \\r\\nrights of redemption and savings as are prescribed in this charter \\r\\nfor the sale of unpaid taxes: Provided, nevertheless, that if any per- \\r\\n\\r\\nson who is reported in the jury\\x92s report to be affected by the proposed \\r\\nimprovement be dissatisfied with the amount of damage or of enhanced \\r\\nvalue with which he has been assessed, or if the aldermen be dissatis- \\r\\nfied with any item in the report, then in that case either party may \\r\\nappeal, on the item with which they are dissatisfied, to the next term \\r\\nof the superior court of Forsyth county, by giving the adverse party \\r\\nor parties ten days\\x92 notice in writing. The appellate court, in either \\r\\ncase, shall have power to increase or diminish the amount of damages \\r\\nor enhanced valuation which has been assessed, but shall in nowise \\r\\nadjudicate the necessity of the improvement, and the questions of \\r\\ndamages or benefits shall be submitted to a jury under the direction \\r\\nof the judge, to be assessed by the jury under the ordinary rules\\x91of \\r\\naction for damages: Provided, however, that such appeal shall in \\r\\nnowise hinder or delay the aldermen in making the proposed \\r\\nimprovements, but it shall be lawful for them or their agent to enter \\r\\nupon and use the property so condemned as soon as the same has been \\r\\ncondemned by order of the board.

And for the purpose of successfully operating water-works \\r\\nor sewer-pipes contemplated by this section, the aldermen of the \\r\\ncity of Winston are fully authorized to extend the lines of water- \\r\\nworks or sewer-pipes beyond the city limits in any direction thought \\r\\nmost advisable, with all the rights and privileges belonging to said \\r\\naldermen within the city limits in addition to the authority herein \\r\\ngranted: Provided, however, that in case of discontinuance of the use \\r\\nof the land either for the purposes mentioned in this or the preceding \\r\\nsection, and on its reverting to the owners, the city shall have the right \\r\\nto remove any property or improvement under its authority erected \\r\\nthereon: Provided further, that the owner or owners of land, right-of- \\r\\nway, water or water-courses required for the purposes mentioned, \\r\\nshall have at least twenty days\\x92 written notice, under the seal of the \\r\\nmayor\\x92s Office, of the time and place of meeting and of the purposes \\r\\nof the jury.
